# Graphical User Interface Explanation

## Web-Based Interactive Interface (1 Paragraph)

The application features a web-based graphical user interface built with Streamlit that provides an intuitive and interactive environment for PVD consolidation analysis without requiring programming knowledge. The interface is organized with a left sidebar containing all input parameters and a main panel for displaying results and visualizations. Users can specify the number of soil layers and configure each layer's properties including thickness, vertical and horizontal consolidation coefficients, recompression and compression ratios, initial effective stress, and preconsolidation pressure through clearly labeled input fields with appropriate units. The PVD installation parameters section allows users to define drain diameter, smear zone diameter, unit cell diameter, drain length, horizontal and smear zone permeabilities, and well discharge capacity, with an option to select negligible well resistance for typical applications. Analysis parameters including applied surcharge, maximum analysis time, and computational time step are easily adjustable through numeric input controls. Upon clicking the "Run Analysis" button, the application performs all calculations and immediately displays a large, professional-quality settlement versus time curve with an inverted y-axis showing settlement progressing downward as it occurs physically in the field. The results panel presents key metrics in visually distinct cards including final settlement, time to achieve 50% and 90% consolidation, total resistance factor, and the three individual PVD influence factors, providing engineers with comprehensive performance indicators at a glance. A download button enables users to export the complete time-settlement data as a CSV file for further analysis or reporting, making the tool practical for both preliminary design studies and detailed engineering documentation in ground improvement projects.
