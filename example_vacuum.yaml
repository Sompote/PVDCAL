# PVD installation properties

                              # Adjust based on soil type and drain spacing

# Staged loading configuration
# Each stage: start_time, surcharge, vacuum
loading_stages:
  # Stage 1: Install PVD and apply vacuum only
  - start_time: 0.0
    surcharge: 0.0
    vacuum: 80.0              # 80 kPa vacuum (no fill yet)

  # Stage 2: After 3 months, add partial surcharge
  - start_time: 0.25          # 0.25 years = 3 months
    surcharge: 40.0
    vacuum: 80.0              # 40 kPa fill + 80 kPa vacuum = 120 kPa equivalent

  # Stage 3: After 6 months, increase surcharge
  - start_time: 0.5
    surcharge: 70.0
    vacuum: 80.0              # 70 kPa fill + 80 kPa vacuum = 150 kPa equivalent

  # Stage 4: After 1.5 years, remove vacuum, full surcharge
  - start_time: 1.5
    surcharge: 100.0
    vacuum: 0.0               # 100 kPa fill only (vacuum removed)
