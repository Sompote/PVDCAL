# Algorithm for PVD Consolidation Analysis - Textbook Version

## Computational Algorithm (2 Paragraphs)

The computational algorithm for prefabricated vertical drain consolidation analysis employs a finite difference time-stepping approach to solve the coupled radial-vertical consolidation problem in multilayer soil systems. The algorithm begins by calculating three critical PVD influence factors that govern consolidation rate: the geometric factor accounts for the drain spacing ratio, the smear effect factor quantifies permeability reduction around the drain due to installation disturbance, and the well resistance factor represents head loss within the drain itself. These three factors combine to form the total resistance factor, which typically ranges from 2 to 8 for effective PVD systems. The soil profile is discretized into a vertical mesh with adaptive spacing, typically using 10 nodes per meter, and each node is assigned properties from its corresponding layer including vertical and horizontal consolidation coefficients, recompression ratio, and compression ratio. Using an explicit time-stepping scheme with time increments typically ranging from 0.001 to 0.01 years, the algorithm calculates horizontal consolidation through an exponential decay model based on the dimensionless time factor for radial drainage, while vertical consolidation follows Terzaghi's classical solution using appropriate approximations for different time factor ranges.

The total degree of consolidation at each node is computed through a coupling relationship that properly accounts for simultaneous horizontal and vertical drainage, recognizing that both drainage mechanisms operate independently but affect the same excess pore pressure field. Settlement is calculated at each time step by integrating the degree of consolidation with soil compressibility characteristics, distinguishing between recompression and virgin compression phases based on the relationship between current stress, initial stress, and preconsolidation pressure. The algorithm marches forward in time until reaching the specified maximum duration, accumulating settlement contributions from all layers to generate the complete settlement-time curve. This approach provides rapid computation, typically completing a full analysis in 2 to 5 seconds for problems involving 3 to 5 soil layers analyzed over a 20-year period. The implementation has been validated against published analytical solutions with less than one percent error for idealized conditions. The method assumes small strain theory, constant soil properties during consolidation, uniform initial excess pore pressure distribution, and axisymmetric drainage conditions, making it suitable for preliminary design and analysis of ground improvement projects involving PVD systems where engineers can optimize drain spacing and length, evaluate consolidation time requirements, and generate settlement predictions for construction scheduling and surcharge removal planning.
